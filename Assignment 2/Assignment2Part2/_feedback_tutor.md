# First impression #


Followed the instructions.


Looks reasonable.

Make more use of markdown, for example lists, bold, and headings.

But generally an impressive effort - well done. 


# Acknowledgements #


Have not acknowledged Coblind color blindness simulator.

Have not acknowledged WebAIM contract checker.

Did you talk to anyone about it (friend, tutor, etc?)  Did you learn anything from the lectures or elsewhere?

# Choice #


Justification persuasive.  Good to talk about why it was interesting to you as well as how it fits into your skill set.




Confidence persuasive but say more about yourself - why do you think you are equipped to deal with this?




# Design #


Diagram took about 30 seconds to understand.


The accessibility description is fine but could be more detailed.
Impressed with the accessibility description.
The diagram might be hard to read for someone who's partially sighted.

The flowchart is good and helpful, but hard to read - make your writing bigger!  There is a lot going on here, so I think the diagram needs to be a bit bigger (not more on it, just the contents more spread out.)

The flowchart could be improved by having one or more examples running down the side where each step shows the changes.

Consider having multiple examples in the same diagram.

Clear relationship between the diagram and the pseudo-code.

Reorder your algorithm. It's generally clearer to discard the problem cases first. Alternatively do this later as an optimisation step as an extra part of your worksheet.




Design not explained well - give some explanation here.  However, the pseudo-code looks convincing.

Can you find a way to motivate a beginner to try this challenge other
than for the pure job of writing code.

## Description ##


Try to make the first sentence motivate the user to do this challenge, for example can you say why this is useful or interesting.  You need to give them an idea of what a spoonerism is - this has to be inferred from the description.  But otherwise, this is nicely explained.


Try using more examples - you only give one for each case.


# Overall #


This is promising - there are ways you could improve this but the core elements are in place and look good.
