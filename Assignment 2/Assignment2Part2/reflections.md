# Good and useful things #

The part of my work I am most proud of is the flowchart; it was challenging to 
make it both readable and beginner-friendly, and it forced me to break down the 
complex problem into manageable chunks ("The flowchart is good and helpful, 
but hard to read" - Fiona McNeil). 
Due to perseverance, I was able to overcome the difficulty of the challenge,
creating a clear, neat diagram using OneNote, adding a key for clarity.

By far the most beneficial resource for this assignment was the codegolf 
post itself. Not only did the OP provide high quality examples, but they 
explained the challenge succinctly, and clearly stated how to approach any 
special cases. Without such a detailed post, it would have been more 
difficult to make the worksheet engaging and suitable for beginners.

Originally, I did not take into consideration the needs of those with
low vision ("The diagram might be hard to read for someone who's partially 
sighted" - Fiona McNeil) ("Have not acknowledged WebAIM contract checker" - 
Fiona McNeil) and my diagram was originally very cluttered and messy. However, 
this has taught me to always consider accessibility needs when creating 
worksheets/code that is intended to be seen by others.



# What you would do differently #

Firstly, I would improve my time management skills; I started part 1 of the 
assignment way too late, leaving little time to double-check everything, and 
cut it close with the first deadline, which was stressful.

Secondly, I would spend more time to understand the problem itself before 
creating the worksheet, since, during the first draft, I made a few errors 
with my explanations/examples.

Thirdly, I would make more use of the tutorials which were designed to prep 
me for the assignment, since I found that I forgot much of the markdown 
syntax when it came to constructing the worksheet.

# What you have learnt #

This assignment has definitely improved my ability in modularization, since 
I had to break down the problem in such a way so that a beginner could 
attempt to find a solution ("Reorder your algorithm" - Fiona McNeil).

Additionally, the assignment has shown me how to present information in a 
clear, engaging way ("Try to make the first sentence motivate the user to do 
this challenge" - Fiona McNeil), highlighting the interesting parts of the 
problem to the 
beginner

# What effect this has had on you #

This assignment has greatly improved my time-management and organisational 
skills, since it was a large project that required substantial time to 
complete. Part 1 showed me how to break down the assignment into smaller 
tasks that seemed much more achievable, and I took this approach further in 
part 2, only working on one part at a time before I had completed the whole 
assignment. I will continue to take this approach in future assignments this 
year and throughout the course.

Additionally, in the future I will make more use of the resources/peers 
around me, since I found I was relying on my own knowledge for most of this 
assignment rather than asking others for help, which made the assignment far 
more difficult.
