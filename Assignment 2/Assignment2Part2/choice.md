# Spoonerisms in Finnish #

## Main justifications ##

The reason I chose to undertake this topic was because I find other
languages interesting. Additionally, I think the topic covers a range
of programming techniques (including nested for loops, conditionals,
java methods relating to strings, etc.) which I could explain to beginners to 
improve my overall ability to think like a programmer. 
As an intermediate programmer, who has had experience using multiple OOP 
languages prior to this assignment, I felt as though the challenge would 
allow me to use some creativity to solve the problem with an elegant solution.


## Confidence ##

This challenge seems to be of a high quality since it is based on a 
university programming course at Aalto University, but the OP has modified 
it to increase its difficulty. Additionally, the OP responded to followup 
questions on the same day, and was specific in answering the queries, and 
updated the question accordingly to get rid of any doubt. In the challenge 
itself, the OP was clear as to what was required, specifying the I/O, and 
clarifying how special cases did not apply.

Regarding the answers submitted, due to the nature of the challenge, 
many 'cheats' which codegolfers regularly use could not be used here, and so 
more creativity was required to code the shortest program possible to solve 
the challenge.
